### Agenda

- What is FOSS?
- Why FOSS is important?
- Demo
- How you can be part of FOSS?
- Why should you be part of FOSS?

### What is FOSS?
- "free" as in "free speech", not as in "free lunch"
- you are free to use the software for any purpose
- you are allowed access to the source code
- works based on the 4 pillars of freedom

Note:
- the free software movement is lead by Free Software Foundation (FSF)
- founded by Richard Stallman (known for GNU, gcc, etc.) in 1985

------

#### 4 pillars of freedom
- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

Note:
- no restricted EULA
- redistribution of the software is according to the license under which it is distributed
- permissive licenses allow you to do whatever you want with the software
  - copy left licenses requires your source code to be open sourced as well

------

#### Who builds FOSS?
- source code is publicly available
- anyone can contribute
- driven by community
- moderated by maintainers

------

#### How does FOSS projects make money?
- software development involves a lot of cost
- some of it is covered by donations
- some provide paid support
- some provide additional features for a fee

---

### Why is FOSS important?
- freedom of use/control
- increased security/privacy
- low/no cost
- customization
- reuse and efficiency
- but, I'm not a software professional...?

Note:
- having the freedom of looking at the source code
- keeping a copy and/or consult someone with the know-how

------

#### Drawbacks of FOSS
- security
- compatibility
- feature completeness
- continuation and availability

---

### Demo

Note:
1. Kubuntu
2. Firefox
3. libreoffice
4. Blender
5. Audacity
6. TeX with Kile?
7. Octave

---

### Why should you be part of FOSS?

------

#### Learning
- you can learn how bigger projects are
  - designed
  - developed
  - tested
  - released
  - documented
  - maintained
- you can learn how to read code

------

#### Contributions
- open source contributions are valuable assets in interviews
- you get to feel how a typical IT company runs while you are in college
- whole community benefits from your contributions
- you can open source your projects and share the knowledge with the community

Note:
- if you are a contributor to an open source project, it is understood that you are familiar with the ways of the software industry and the effort to train you will be less. this is a plus in interviews.
- if you identify and fix a security issue, you are helping the world be a better and safer place
- do not reinvent the wheel

---

### How you can be part of FOSS?

------

#### Using a version control software
- all the open source projects are maintained using version control software
- keeps track of the files in terms of the changes that are made to it
- common version control systems include Git, Subversion, Mercurial, etc.
- make a copy of the source code
- add the changes to your copy of source code
- submit the changes to the original source code repository

------

#### What can you contribute?
- bug fixes
- features
- documentation
- process improvements
